ARRetail 
=====================
With the ARRetail ViroCore demo, users are able to choose furniture from an Android ListView, and then place and drag the objects around an AR environment. This shows the ease with which Viro allows you build experiences similar to the [Amazon AR Application](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhdOzpblrm0).

This example is meant to be used with our tutorial [here](https://blog.viromedia.com/tutorial-how-to-build-amazons-ar-view-for-arcore-android-using-virocore-and-java-ba1cc3ff2d87).

Or refer to the instructions for setting up the sample code [here](https://github.com/viromedia/virocore/blob/master/README.md).
